## TODO

- Write copy for About page and insert it
  - Software developer currently spending my time working with the Web. Focusing
    mainly on JavaScript and other languages that have Web compile targets
    (TypeScript, Reason, WebAssembly etc.).
  - Love the experience that modern languages and frameworks provide to both
    users and developers alike. They mean faster iteration speeds for
    developers, and in general, faster programs for our users.
  - Passionate about Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
  - Linux and PC building enthusiast.
